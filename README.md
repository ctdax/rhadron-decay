# rhadron-decay

A revised version of CMSSW's SimG4Core that includes R-hadron decay through Pythia8.

Pass a custom SLHA file with RHadron widths to `process.generator.SLHAFileForPythia8`. The decay table is read by `CustomParticleFactory`, where only the width is read to establish the lifetime. Decay products inside of the decay table are not read, rather the decay products are generated by the external decayer. The external decayer `RHadronPythiaDecayer` is established as the external decayer for RHadrons in `CustomPhysicsList`.
